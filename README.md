# 🌐Creative Web Demo - Full-Stack Task 4  

---

## Enhanced Landing Page With Backend Integration  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This task is part of my ongoing **Full-Stack Internship at CoreTech Innovations**.  
The goal was to improve the landing page created in **Task 3** by adding new front-end interactions, backend functionality, and database connectivity.  
This upgrade focuses on making the page more interactive, responsive, and fully connected to a working backend system that processes and stores form submissions.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The purpose of this task was to continue practicing full-stack development by enhancing an existing project.  
This includes improving UI behavior, handling form data properly, creating backend routes, and saving user information in a database.  
The task helps strengthen the understanding of how the front-end, backend, and database work together in a simple full-stack workflow.
