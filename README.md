# 🌐Creative Web Demo - Full-Stack Task 4  

## Enhanced Landing Page With Backend Integration  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This task is part of my ongoing **Full-Stack Internship at CoreTech Innovations**. The goal was to improve the landing page created in **Task 3** by adding new front-end interactions, animations, transitions, layouts while keeping backend functionality, and database connectivity. This upgrade focuses on making the page more interactive, responsive, and fully connected to a working backend system that processes and stores form submissions.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The purpose of this task was to continue practicing full-stack development by enhancing an existing project. This includes improving UI behavior, handling form data properly, creating backend routes, and saving user information in a database. The task helps strengthen the understanding of how the front-end, backend, and database work together in a simple full-stack workflow. Now it isn't about just a simple form handling at bakend but a complete simple website giving full understanding of how frontend and backend connection works in real projects.
